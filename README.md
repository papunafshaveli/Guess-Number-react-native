# Guess a Number - React Native Mini-Project

This is a React Native mobile app built with TypeScript, where the user provides a number as input, and the app (acting as the computer) attempts to guess the number based on the user's hints (`higher` or `lower`). This project is a fun twist on the classic "Guess a Number" game.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can input a number for the app to guess.
- **Intelligent Guessing**: The app narrows down possible numbers using the `higher` or `lower` hints provided by the user.
- **Interactive Interface**: A simple and intuitive design for an enjoyable user experience.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on both Android and iOS devices.
